I am a Junior Research Associate in Cardiac AI at the Digital Environment Research Institute (DERI), Queen Mary University of London. My research focuses on deep learning and computer vision applications in medical signal processing.

Currently, I work under the supervision of Dr. Xu Chen, contributing to the development of next-generation AI tools for cardiac health monitoring.

### Current Research & Professional Focus
I lead the research on READ-ECG, a novel framework designed to digitize paper-based ECG records. Unlike traditional and other modern methods, my approach utilizes an End-to-End architecture to decouple signal reconstruction from clinical interpretation. This work is currently being prepared for MICCAI 2026.

### Education
