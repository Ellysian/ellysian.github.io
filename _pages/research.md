My research focuses on the intersection of deep learning and clinical signal processing, specifically aiming to bridge the gap between legacy paper-based medical records and modern AI-driven diagnostics.

### Publications & Manuscripts
**READ-ECG: Digitization of ECG Papers via Attention-Based Decoding**  
*Emil Gasimov, X. Zheng, D. Shi, X. Diao, F. Cheng, G. Slabaugh, and X. Chen*  
In preparation for submission to the 29th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2026).

### Projects
#### READ-ECG: Signal Reconstruction
As an MSc student at QMUL, I led the development of a novel CNN-Transformer model designed to reconstruct high-fidelity digital signals from paper ECGs. 
* Designed an experimental framework to quantify the performance gap between signal and image domain and validate the superiority of the proposed pipeline on downstream
tasks
* Engineered a scalable pipeline using datasets like PTB-XL and MIMIC-IV-ECG.

#### Retinal OCT Scan Analysis
Previously worked on unsupervised domain adaptation to detect early signs of Alzheimer’s Disease from OCT scans.
* Modified CycleGAN architecture to adapt segmented scans to unsegmented datasets (UK Biobank) while preserving labels.
