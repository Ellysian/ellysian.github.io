### Advanced Data Augmentation for Cow Behavior Estimation
Developed for my BS Thesis, this project addressed data scarcity in agricultural AI. We innovated augmentation techniques for numerical time-series data to improve behavior estimation accuracy by accounting for physical responses.

### Rubik's Cube Solver from Photo
Implemented a classical computer vision based pipeline to recognize individual facelets from a cube's image and solve it algorithmically.

### WhatsApp GPT-3.5 Fine-Tuning
Preprocessed and parsed personal WhatsApp chat history to fine-tune a GPT-3.5 model, enabling it to emulate a specific messaging style.

### GPU-Accelerated Graph Partitioning
Conducted research on sparse matrices and graph embeddings using GOSH to optimize logistic regression outcomes and link prediction.
